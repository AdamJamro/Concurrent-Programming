## Description

This course is designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of concurrent programming. 
The course will cover certain concepts of concurrent programming with a more nuanced minute approach, 
including threads, goroutines and go runtime, various synchronization techniques, locks, and condition variables, deadlock, and starvation. 
It will include hands-on programming assignments that will make the content of this repository.
